# Contribution Guidelines

Thank you for considering to contribute to this project.

---

First off, there are some simple rules. The following apply:

- Do not propose any significant changes without prior testing.
- Create issues for any major changes and enhancements that you wish to make. Discuss things transparently and get feedback.
- Be respectful when discussing code changes.

Other than the above rules, have at it. Make your code as readible and efficiant as possible. Explain it if it starts to get complex.
