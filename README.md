This is not the repo that my bot runs on and this repo may not be up-to-date with what my bot has completely. Changes made here by contributors will be made to my bot eventually.

## Why Ai Ohto?

I don't know. I thought she was a cool character at the time and I wanted to do something similar to [Zero Two](https://zerotwo.bot/). Silly reason, yes, I know.

## Can I host this myself?

I suppose so.

## Can I contribute?

Sure. Read the [Contributing Guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md) before submitting a Pull Request.

## This code is bad

I'm aware.
